                <h2>The Business Law Matters We Handle</h2>
                <h3>Business Formation and Structure</h3>
                <p>Each business structure has its own legal rights, protections and liabilities. Whether it’s a sole proprietorship, a partnership, an LLC, or a corporation, we can guide you through choosing the most beneficial structure, handle all the paperwork, and help your business start off on a solid legal footing.</p>
                <p>We can also help you change your business structure if you’ve been operating for a period of time already, and we also help local businesses with dissolution strategies.</p>

                <h3>Contract Negotiation and Dispute Resolution</h3>
                <p>We can draft, review, and negotiate contracts that protect your interests, whether with suppliers, customers, or employees. Should disputes arise, we represent your interests and aim for resolutions that favor your business. We certainly don’t anticipate any disputes or issues, but you want an experienced attorney on your side should issues arise.</p>

                <h3>Compliance and Licensing</h3>
                <p>Myrtle Beach businesses must navigate the maze of licenses and permits. We understand local, state, and federal regulations, and help your business operate legally and efficiently.</p>

                <h3>Employment Law Support</h3>
                <p>Are you struggling with hiring practices or employee disputes? Or do you simply want to avoid any such problems before they can even start? We help you create comprehensive employment policies that comply with labor laws, and we’ll protect your company from potential lawsuits.</p>

                <h3>Intellectual Property Protection</h3>
                <p>Let us help you secure your intellectual assets, including trademarks, copyrights, and patents. Especially in the age of digital products and content sales online, IP protection is more important than ever.</p>
